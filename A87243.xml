            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>UPon the twelfth of this inſtant I marched from Moyallo to meet the Rebells army, who that morning marched from Kintuirk towards me, with Twelve hundred horſe and Seven thouſand foot, but they gave themſelves out to be Two thouſand horſe and Nine thouſand foot; and both armies came in view one of another about one in the afternoon, ours being Twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred horſe and near Four thouſand foot: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they inſtantly took a Hill of ſtrength and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and drew up, which being two miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from us, we had not day-light enough to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any thing upon them, and therefore lodged our men in a convenient place about a mile from them, from whence we might obſerve that we could not charge them where they were, but upon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage; and being doubtful that they might ſtand a while the next morning upon that ground, in expectation that we would come up to them, I writ the incloſed Letter to the Lord <hi>Taaff,</hi> to invite him to fight upon a fair plain, that lay between both ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and would be indifferent to both ſides: To which he gave o other anſwer, but by word of mouth to my Trumpeter, That he was not ſo little a Soldier, as to forgo any advantage of ground he could gain: And I do now finde that there is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie that <hi>Mac Donogh</hi> ſhould ſpill much Engliſh blood upon Knocknaſs, which heretofore hath been the name of that hill, and my Lord <hi>Taaff</hi> conceiving himſelf to be that <hi>Mac Donogh,</hi> in regard the eſtate
<pb facs="tcp:161331:3"/>of <hi>Mac Donogh</hi> in Conaught was made the reward of his Grandfathers ſervice againſt the Rebels the laſt Wars (which is now his) he would not be drawn from the Hill, to which therefore we did advance; and finding (that, as they were drawn up, we ſhould not onely have loſt the advantage of the wind and ſun, but have been alſo forced to charge upon much diſadvantage to our horſe, if we had gone on direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on their front; we drew to the right hand of them and found a piece of ground within a convenient di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, to play with Ordnance upon their Right wing, where I cauſed two pieces to play, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that I might diſcompoſe the form they were in; and in the mean time I directed the drawing of our men to the ditch at the foot of their Hill, that they might be ready to fall on, whileſt they ſhould be removing from their ground.</p>
                  <p>But after two ſhot was made (one whereof ſlew a Trumpeter of theirs) they perceiving that the Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance would force them from that ground, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly came on down the hill to meet our men, and at the ſame inſtant that we brake their main Body, and left Wing, they brake a part of our left Wing of Horſe, being the middle Diviſion of three that were on that ſide; the other two routed thoſe that char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them, and following the execution, diſcerned not the advantage gained by the Rebels upon thoſe cloſe by them, where Col: <hi>Purcel</hi> with his Horſe, and Sir <hi>Alexander mac Donnel,</hi> whom they call <hi>Collae Kittagh,</hi> with his Red-ſhanks, ſlew Sir <hi>William Brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;</hi> and Col: <hi>Gray</hi> then had the execution of our Forlorn-hope of Foot, under the command of Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Col: <hi>Criſp,</hi> who was taken priſoner, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor <hi>Brown,</hi> who was ſlain with about Forty of their
<pb facs="tcp:161331:3"/>men that were drawn thither to ſecure the Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance which Sir <hi>Alexander mac Donnel</hi> poſſeſſed a while (as alſo our Baggage) until I hapned to look back that way (and perceiving them chaſing our men) I commanded two Diviſions of Horſe, who were the Reſerve of the right Wing, to charge them, which was exceedingly well performed, and Sir <hi>Alexander</hi> and his Lieut: Col: ſlain, with moſt of all his Red-ſhanks, of whom I believe there was not above a fourth part that eſcaped. This Fight began a little before two in the Afternoon; the diſpute laſted not above half a quarter of an hour, but the execution ended not in that day: for though we were killing till night, as faſt as we could, yet we found Two or three hundred the next day in the Woods, as we were viewing the bodies, but could not poſſibly get any exact accompt of the number ſlain; for after I had an accompt of more then 2000. that the purſuing parties ſlew in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral walks, I was informed of many hundreds that were ſlain in divers other places, ſo as our men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there were not leſs then Five thouſand ſlain; but I do not think it poſſible there ſhould be above Three thouſand, becauſe the diſpute laſted not at all; and that exeept the three Regiments of Foot that came on with Sir <hi>Alexander mac Donnel,</hi> the reſt made the beſt uſe they could of their heels, to the Woods and Bogs toward Kintuirk, New mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket and Lyfcarrol: yet we cut off Two hundred of their Horſe, and killed many of their Horſemen. We took four Wagons full of Ammunition, but have not yet taken up their arms, whereof I am moſt confident that they have left us near Six thouſand in the field, which is ſo much the more conſiderable a
<pb facs="tcp:161331:4"/>loſs, becauſe ſcarcity of arms amongſt them is very great, as appears by ſome of their Letters, which doth diſcover all the ſecreſie of that party and their deſigns. Wherefore I thought it my duty to preſent them to your Lordſhips, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>I am told by a Gentleman we have taken, that if my Lord <hi>Taaff</hi> do not make an eſcape, That their Supreme Councel will undoubtedly take away his life, having knowledge of his deſign againſt them, which they were firſt occaſioned to grow jealous of by the information he gave them of my offering, and his rejecting a Ceſſation, which he labored to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs them with, whileſt he ſought to gain one from me, to the end he might deſtroy them, and bring the ſole Power into his own hand; which when they began to apprehend, they imployed <hi>Bealing</hi> one of their Councel to diſcourſe with my Lord, about the reaſons of his rejecting a Ceſſation, who diſcovered that there was no ſuch thing: Whereupon the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Councel (ſeeming not to take notice of <hi>Taaffs</hi> deſigns) pretended a neceſſity to have <hi>Owen Rowe</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage with Col: <hi>Munck</hi> and Col: <hi>Jones,</hi> and that all would be at ſtake, and that therefore Four hundred of <hi>Taaffs</hi> horſe muſt inſtantly march to his aſſiſtance, which they ſent him Orders for, but were not obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: On the other ſide, in ſtead of injoyning <hi>Owen Roe</hi> to fight, they expreſly forbid it him, and then reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to let Col: <hi>Munck</hi> and Col: <hi>Jones</hi> take any place, or deſtroy any country, rather then they would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage his army, until they had eſtabliſhed their own Power in the Aſſembly, by the countenance of it. Again, they ſent for my Brother, to whom, by the advice of the Councel of War, I gave liberty unto to go upon his word, to get off that Eſtate he had in

Sir, thus it hath pleaſed the Lord to make our enemies grinde themſelves to powder, whileſt both aym at the Power to deſtroy us; and now, whereas we were the other day ready to periſh by our wants, we have now liberty to diſperſe our ſelves in the Rebels quarters, and take what they afford, whither we have marched with hungry bellies, the Common Soldier having ſpent all his proviſion Twenty four hours before we ſought, and neither Officer or Soldier ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving one bit of bread, or any other victual, but what Oatmeal and fleſh we got in our marches: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am now forced to invite the Countrey to come in under contribution, that I may proſecute this Victory, and at leaſt keep the Rebels from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruiting their Army, if I do not reduce ſome of their chief Gariſons, which I deſign, in caſe I can get this Countrey to bring me in proviſion, whileſt I lie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:161331:5"/>fore them: And thought this Deſign may be too dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to effect this unſeaſonable time of the year, yet if I did not invite the Inhabitants to ſtay at their habitations, and make proviſion for us, I could not poſſibly get one days victual; ſo as I ſhould be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to return home, and leave the Countrey, neither made uſeles to them by deſtruction, nor uſeful to us by preſent Supportation, or future Contribution, which we hope to force from them by this means in ſome conſiderable meaſure, and yet protect them no longer, then the ſeaſon of the year would of it ſelf prove a ſufficient Fortification againſt us: If I could diſcern any other that might better conduce to the advantage of your Service, I ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto apply the endeavors of, Sir,</p>
